      The blue sky with fluffy clouds floats slowly above me from the east, bringing a sense of peace to my heart. Its
      beauty is breathtaking and can make anyone fall in love with it. However, deep down, I know that my life is about
      to change in a way that I cannot predict. Or was it just a dream I had last night while sleeping on a hard, rocky
      bed? Although I cannot remember anything specific about the dream, I can still feel the emotions it brought. I
      would like to know if it will get any new experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new day begins, and I am still sleepy from sleep. I splash cool water on my face, hoping it will shake off the
      remnants of my dreams and my stomach starts growling. Smelling juicy grilled meat. Closing my eyes for a moment, I
      take a deep breath and let the scent guide me. The best way to kick off a beautiful morning, I think to myself, is
      definitely indulging in some leftover lunch from Mike â€“ those savory bites always seem to brighten my day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While eating, I scroll the map, thinking of our last path which is from our hometown. We are going to a small city
      to buy some essentials.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, Mike! Come here I got something for you" I yelled out to Mike.</p>

    <p>
      Mike is My childhood friend, we are both from Firel, a small town in the South of Pooter. I couldn't wait to show
      him my plan. Mike and I always had a special bond, and he's someone I could share anything with. He was a genius
      with his inventions, and his latest creation, called A Cor, was truly remarkable. It was a small box with four
      rollers outside and was powered by water. It was more convenient than a horse and took us on a weeks-long journey.
      The only downside was that it produced a quiet shaking that made it hard to fall asleep. Despite this, He's a bit
      eccentric, but that's just part of his charm. Standing tall at 1.75m, he always dressed for comfort rather than
      style.
    </p>

    <p>He looked at me with confusion and asked, "What?" "Come here!" I yelled.</p>

    <p>
      Despite his confusion, he approached me. I threw him a map that I had bought at the market on the way to the
      Santinento City forest.
